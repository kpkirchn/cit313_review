 <p class="about">My name is Kat and I am a student at IUPUI. I work in ET101 and help students on academic probation. I also tutor and TA for CIT 140 and CIT 213. After I graduate I hope to move out west and pursue technology opportunities. I think it's beautiful out here. Outside of school, I am an avid gamer. I have played World of Warcraft for the past 13 years.</p>
